# GB Studio 2.0 beta 5 Stair Climb Mod

A small modification to `Platform.c` implementing walkable stairs in platformer mode.


# How to Install

1. Eject the engine from your game.
2. Copy the file `Platform.c` from the folder `StairClimbMod/assets/engine/src/states/` in this mod to the same folder in your project.  For example: `YourGreatGame/assets/engine/src/states/`
3. Add stairs to the collisions in your game.


# How to Create Stairs

In this mod, stairs are represented by a combination of collision types.

| Type of Stair | Collision Combination |
| --- | ---|
| Climbed from the left | Collision Left & Ladder |
| Climbed from the right | Collision Right & Ladder |

When the engine sees these collision types placed together it interprets it as climbable stairs. 

**NOTE:** This means that the player cannot stand on top of these stair blocks.  Instead, a platform can be placed right below them.

Please check out the example project included here to see exactly how they work.
